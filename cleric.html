                Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer
                on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that
                spills out to heal his battle-worn com panions.
                Chanting a song of glory, a dw arf sw ings his axe
                in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs
                arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with
                every foe’s fall.
                Calling dow n a curse upon the forces of undeath, a
                human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to
                drive back the zom bies crow ding in on her com panions.
                Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world
                and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods
                they serve, clerics strive to em body the handiwork of
                their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with
                divine magic.

            <h3>Healers & Warriors</h3>
            <p>
                Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of
                the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are
                conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous
                effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who
                seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.
                Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or
                training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and
                ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on
                devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.
                Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and
                inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder
                foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of
                plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven
                to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will
                benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on
                their combat training to let them wade into melee with
                the power of the gods on their side.

            <h3>Divine Agents</h3>
            <p>
                Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a
                cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple
                service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and
                sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some
                cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed
                as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and
                involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics
                are rare in most hierarchies.
                W hen a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually
                because his or her god dem ands it. Pursuing the goals
                of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the
                walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in
                ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect
                their deities’ w orshipers, which can mean fighting
                rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring
                nations, or sealing a portal that w ould allow a demon
                prince to enter the world.
                M ost adventuring clerics maintain som e connection to
                established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple
                might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a
                position to demand it.
