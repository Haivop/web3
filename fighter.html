                A human in clanging plate arm or holds her shield
                before her as she runs toward the m assed goblins. An
                elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers
                the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite
                bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping
                the two combatants coordinate their assault to the
                best advantage.
                A dw arf in chain mail interposes his shield between
                the ogre’s club and his com panion, knocking the deadly
                blow aside. His com panion, a half-elf in scale armor,
                swings tw o scim itars in a blinding whirl as she circles
                the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
                A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with
                his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
                them around for the crow d’s delight—and his own
                tactical advantage. His opponent’s sw ord flares with
                blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing
                forth to smite him.
                All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most
                diverse class of characters in the w orlds of Dungeons &
                Dragons . Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
                champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
                and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an
                unparalleled mastery with w eapons and armor, and a
                thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they
                are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and
                staring it defiantly in the face.

                    <h3>Well-Rounded Specialists</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fighters learn the basics of all com bat styles. Every
                        fighter can sw ing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
                        longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes
                        in a net with som e degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is
                        adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that
                        basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a
                        certain style of combat. S om e concentrate on archery,
                        som e on fighting with two w eapons at once, and som e
                        on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This
                        com bination of broad general ability and extensive
                        specialization m akes fighters superior combatants
                        on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

                    <h3>Trained for Danger</h3>
                    <p>
                        Not every m em ber of the city watch, the village militia,
                        or the queen’s army is a fighter. M ost of these troops are
                        relatively untrained soldiers with only the m ost basic
                        com bat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers,
                        trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar
                        figures are fighters.
                        Som e fighters feel drawn to use their training as
                        adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and
                        other dangerous w ork com m on am ong adventurers is
                        second nature for a fighter, not all that different from
                        the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks,
                        perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in
                        the city watch have the opportunity to discover a m agic
                        flame tongue sword, for example.
