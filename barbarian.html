                A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard,
                draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he
                charges toward the frost giant w ho dared poach his
                people’s elk herd.
                A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her
                authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck
                with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
                Frothing at the mouth, a dw arf slam s his helmet into
                the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored
                elbow into the gut o f another.
                These barbarians, different as they might be, are
                defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and
                unthinking fury. M ore than a mere emotion, their anger
                is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting
                assault of a storm, the churning turmoil o f the sea.
                For som e, their rage springs from a com m union
                with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling
                reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every
                barbarian, rage is a pow er that fuels not just a battle
                frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and
                feats of strength.

            <h3>Primal Instincts</h3>
            <p>
                People of towns and cities take pride in how their
                civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if
                denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To
                a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign
                of weakness. The strong em brace their animal n atu rekeen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage.
                Barbarians are uncom fortable when hedged in by walls
                and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands:
                the tundra, jungle, or grasslands w here their tribes
                live and hunt.
                Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat.
                They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over,
                giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A
                barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few
                times without resting, but those few rages are usually
                sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

            <h3>A Life of Danger</h3>
            <p>
                Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians”
                by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A
                true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as
                a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar
                role as a protector of the people and a leader in times
                of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught
                with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying
                monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger
                so that their people don’t have to.
                Their courage in the face of danger m akes barbarians
                perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a
                way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of
                the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some
                barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the
                tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds
                formed among the members of their adventuring parties.
