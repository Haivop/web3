                Signaling for her com panions to wait, a halfling creeps
                forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear
                to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the
                lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into
                the shadows as her fighter friend m oves forward to kick
                the door open.
                A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
                accom plice prepares for her part in the ambush. W hen
                their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway,
                the accom plice cries out, the slaver com es to investigate,
                and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can
                make a sound.
                Suppressing a giggle, a gnom e w aggles her fingers
                and magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt.
                In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is
                open, and she and her com panions are free to make
                their escape.
                R ogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’
                vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.
                They have a knack for finding the solution to just about
                any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and
                versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful
                adventuring party.

                R ogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of
                a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their com bat
                abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
                characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
                deception, while others refine the skills that help them
                in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
                disarm ing traps, and opening locks.
                W hen it com es to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
                over brute strength. A rogue w ould rather make one
                precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will
                hurt the target most, than w ear an opponent down
                with a barrage of attacks. R ogues have an almost
                supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn
                magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

                Every town and city has its share of rogues. M ost of
                them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class,
                m aking a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and
                con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized
                into thieves’ guilds or crim e families. Plenty of rogues
                operate independently, but even they som etim es
                recruit apprentices to help them in their scam s
                and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as
                locksm iths, investigators, or exterminators, which can
                be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and
                wererats—haunt the sewers.
                As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law.
                S om e are hardened crim inals w ho decide to seek
                their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up
                a life of adventure to escape from the law. S om e have
                learned and perfected their skills with the explicit
                purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts
                in search of treasure.
